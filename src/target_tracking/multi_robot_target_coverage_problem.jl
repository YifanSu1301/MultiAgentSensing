# This file provides most of the implementation of multi-robot target *coverage*
# problems.
#
# These coverage problems involve controlling robots to cover a number of
# targets e.g. to keep them within range of onboard sensors.
#
# This problem is applicable to cinematography whereas robots may have good
# estimations of position but otherwise seek to "cover" targets with sensors or
# cameras.
